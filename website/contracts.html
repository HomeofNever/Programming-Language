<p>
For this assignment, we require that you write comments in the style outlined below. 
It follows "How to design programs", a textbook by the developers of DrScheme/DrRacket. 
There are 4 required sections: Contract, Purpose, Example, and Definition,  
as in the example comment for function <tt>area-of-ring</tt>:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
;; Contract: area-of-ring : number * number -> number
;; Purpose: to compute the area of a ring whose radius is
;; outer and whose hole has a radius of inner
;; Example: (area-of-ring 5 3) should produce 50.24
;; Definition:
(define (area-of-ring outer inner)
  (- (area-of-disk outer)
     (area-of-disk inner)))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The goal of designing a function is to create a mechanism that consumes and produces data. 
Therefore, every function has a meaningful name and a statement of what kind of information 
it consumes and produces. This is called a CONTRACT and is, essentially, an unchecked type
signature of the function. The contract for <tt>area-of-ring</tt> is:
</p>

<p><tt>;; Contract: area-of-ring : number * number -> number</tt><br></p>

<p>
Semicolons indicate that the line is a Scheme comment. The contract consists of two parts.
The first, to the left of the colon, states the function's name. The second, to the right 
of the colon, specifies what kind of data the function consumes and what it produces; 
the inputs are separated from the output by an arrow.
</p>

<p>
In addition, every function has a short PURPOSE statement, that briefly describes 
what the function computes. For most functions, one or two lines will suffice. The purpose 
statement for our running example <tt>area-of-ring</tt> is:
</p>

<p>
<tt>;; Purpose: to compute the area of a ring whose radius is</tt><br>
<tt>;; outer and whose hole has a radius of inner</tt><br>
</p>

<p>The EXAMPLE section shows a call and the expected return result, 
and the DEFINITION section contains the actual Scheme code for the funtion:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
;; Example: (area-of-ring 5 3) should produce 50.24
;; Definition:
(define (area-of-ring outer inner)
  (- (area-of-disk outer)
     (area-of-disk inner)))
</pre>
</p>


<h2>Additional Examples</h2>

<p>Function <tt>map</tt> (a higher-order polymorphic function):</p>

<p>
<pre>
;; Contract: map : (a -> b) * (list a) -> (list b)
;; Purpose: to apply function f on each element of list l
;; Example: (map abs '(-1 2 -3)) should produce (1 2 3)
;; Definition:
(define (map f l)
  (if (null? l) '() (cons (f (car l)) (map f (cdr l)))))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The above contract states that <tt>map</tt> consumes 2 arguments: the first argument 
is a function that takes a value of type <tt>a</tt> and returns a value 
of type <tt>b</tt>, and the second argument is a list whose elements are 
of type <tt>a</tt>. Function <tt>map</tt> returns a list whose elements are of type <tt>b</tt>. 
Here <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> to denote type variables that can be 
instantiated to arbitrary concrete types. Note however that <tt>a</tt> 
and <tt>b</tt> link the arguments and return type of map: function <tt>f</tt> 
takes a type <tt>a</tt>, and therefore the list l must consists of elements 
of type <tt>a</tt>, as <tt>f</tt> is applied on each element of <tt>l</tt>; 
furthermore, the return value must be a list with elements of type <tt>b</tt>.
</p>

<p>Function <tt>foldl</tt> (another higher-order polymorphic function):</p>

<p>
<pre>
;; Contract: foldl : (b * a -> b) * (list a) * b -> b
;; Purpose: to fold (i.e., reduce) the list l into a single value
;; Example: (foldl + '(1 2 3) 0) should produce 6
;; Definition:
(define (foldl op l id)
  (if (null? l) id (foldl op (cdr l) (op id (car l)))))
</pre>
